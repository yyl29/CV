## Yan-Yi Li

Makers Academy graduate with a curiosity and passion for technology. Proactive learner and problem-solver with proven track record of quickly learning and applying new technologies. Looking for a challenging role as a junior developer in an environment where I can hone my programming skills, while contributing to a team that also values software craftsmanship.

## Skills

#### Web Development

One of my first experiences of programming was during my maths degree where I took the computational projects course. It probably started with a `"Hello, World!"` programme, but it then quickly turned to solving problems like encryption based on the use of large prime numbers. Although the emphasis was on developing mathematical skills, I was intrigued by the capabilities of programming. Last year, I decided to learn programming *the right way* and applied for Makers Academy.

Makers introduced to me Ruby and Javascript as programming languages, but more importantly I've also learnt industry best practices, focusing on Test Driven Development and Agile methodologies. I found myself immersing in new technologies constantly, and applying my analytical problem solving skills through daily remote pair-programming and team projects. Below are just a handful of the projects that I've worked on.

Project                                       | Description
----------------------------------------------|---------------------------
[FairMuse](https://github.com/yyl29/fairMuse) | A music streaming service with Angular frontend and Rails API. Built in just under two weeks by a team of 5 as the final project at Makers Academy.
[Chitter](https://github.com/yyl29/chitter-challenge) | A simple Twitter clone. Built in Ruby with Sinatra as a solo weekend challenge in Week 4.
[Airport](https://github.com/yyl29/airport_challenge) | A command line airport control system built with Ruby and Rspec. My first ever solo TDD project!

#### Music

I started learning the piano at age 5, and music has been a prominent part of my life ever since. It has also equipped me with skills that are essential in other areas, which I then further developed as a freelance musician.

- **Flexible and adaptable in teams**: Worked with numerous orchestras/ensembles of various sizes as a performing musician. Able to learn music fast and adapt well to different groups, even with as little as one rehearsal.
- **Time management and organisational skills**: Managing my busy gigging/teaching schedule while keeping a practice routine can be like solving a sudoku puzzle.
- **Problem solving and communication skills**: When teaching, I have to find ways to help a range of students at different levels to tackle problems and plan lessons to suit individual needs. Patience and understanding are also required when explaining abstract ideas (very often to parents as well!).
